gRPC has become now the defacto standard for RPC.
What started out as a project (stubby) in Google has outgrown itself to a reliable way for RPC.
The below are some of details of why, how of gRPC.

Why not REST
----

* REST has been ruling the internet for more than a decade and taking on REST is like taking on TCP/IP.
* Why then would companies adopt and change from REST.
* Simple call to a server address on a browser works
  * Eg: www.test.com/somerestcall

Problems with REST
----

REST = HTTP + JSON


1. Vocabulary: Provides a very limited set.
	* GET       | Read
	* PUT     | Update/Replace 
	* PATCH   | Update/Modify
	* DELETE  | Delete

2. Not a machine readable format. 
    * Advantage:
		* Being textual and readable gives in a sure advantage of debugging. 
		* Tools for in inspection, modification, testing are readily available.

	* Disadvantages:	
		* With Machine readable API contracts, we can have machine generating code and not Humans writing the code.
		* With REST humans need to write the client APIs and for various languages.
		* Text based costs network bandwidth and is in-efficient.
3. Validations:
	* Field validations are a pain in REST.
5. Streaming is difficult.
6. Bidirectional streaming not possible
7. Operations are difficult to model. Eg: restart machine..


Features of gRPC 
--

1. HTTP2
   * Brings in truckload of advantages of HTTP2
   * Bidirectional streaming etc are listed below.
2. Vocabulary can be literally anything.
   * This means any functionality can be represented.
3. Selective Compression
   * Eg: For, images mixed with text, compression can be turned off.
4. Language Agnostic:
   Client APIs can be instantly generated and not written by humans.
   * Service declarations are written in Interface Description Language (IDL).
	 * This can generate language specific bindings.
	 
	 ==============| <-------------> gRPC Client (RUBY)
	 | gRPC SERVER |
	 |   (golang)  |
	 |=============| <-------------> gRPC Client (JAVA)

5. Field validations are very easy and can be specified right in the .proto file.
   * It is type-safe.
   * A string cannot be passed in while expecting an integer.
6. Cancellation and timeout contracts between client and server is possible.



     ==============|                           ==============| 
     | gRPC SERVER | <----ONE TCP SESSION---> | gRPC client  |
     |   (golang)  |                          |   (C++)      |
     |=============|                          |==============| 
           ||                                       ||
           || ..........HTTP Stream 1.............. ||
           ||                                       ||
           || ..........HTTP Stream 2.............. ||
           ||                                       ||
           || ..........HTTP Stream 3.............. ||


Payload
--
* Protobuf - PB.
* PB are packed and in binary which means it is network efficient.
* PB are 3 to 10 times smaller, and 20 to 100 times faster.

### Transport
* HTTP/2 vs HTTP 1.1


## HTTP1x/2

#### HTTP 1.1 Problems
* Request - Response model
* Head of line blocking which can be solved by pipelining.
* Latency sensitive , TCP handshake is required for every request.

### HTTP/2
* Based on Google's SPDY protocol
* Multiplexed streams, bidirectional interleaved streams on the same TCP conn.
#### Server Side streaming
* Server sends stream of responses on getting client request msg. After sending,
  it sends back server status and optional trailing metadata.
#### Client Side streaming
* Client sends stream of multiple requests to server. Server sends single response.
  typically but not necessarily after it has received all the clientâ€™s requests, 
  along with its status details and optional trailing metadata.


#### Bidirectional streaming

Conclusion
---

* If the intention is to get two systems talking to one another, efficiently, you must consider gRPC.
