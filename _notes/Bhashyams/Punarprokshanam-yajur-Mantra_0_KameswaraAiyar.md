This mantra occurs in the Rig Veda IV Mandala, 39th Sūkta. It also occurs in the 11th Anuvāka of the 5th Prapāthaka of the 1st Kanda of the Taittirīya Samhita. <intro> 
It runs thus. 
द॒धि॒क्राव्ण्णो॑ अकारिषञ्जि॒ष्णोरश्व॑स्य वा॒जिनः॑ ॥ सु॒र॒भि नो॒ मुखा॑ कर॒त्प्र ण॒ आयू॑षि तारिषत् ॥ 
Dadhikrāvnah - of the God Dadhikrávan, Jishnoh - victorious, Aśvasya - Vyāpakasya - pervading (all), Vājinah - Vegaratah - of great speed (understand Stutim - praise), Akārisham - I make; Nah - our, Mukhā - Mukhani - mouths i.e., the eyes and the other senses, Surabhi Surabhīni - fragrant, Karat - Karotu - may he make, Nah - our, Ayūmshi - life, Prtārishat - may he lengthen. 
I sing the praise of the God Dadhikrāvan, who is victorious, all-prevading and who moves with great speed. May he make our mouths (and the senses) fragrant and may he prolong our lives! 
1. Dadhikrāvan - This God is often mentioned in the Veda and is the subject of Sūktas 38, 39 and 40 of the fourth Mandala of the Rig Veda and the 44th Sūkta of the 7th Mandala of the same. He seems to be described in these places as a kind of divine horse. Sometimes he is considered a creation of heaven and earth, sometimes of Mitra and Varuna, and is invoked in the morning with Agni, Ushas and the Aśvins. Sir Monier Williams would derive the word from dadhi - curd (which he takes to represent dew) and kri - to, scatter, in allusion to the rising sun spreading dew and hoarfrost like milk. 
Sāyana regards Dadhikrāvan as a form of Agni. He says in his commentary on the Rig Veda, (Mandala 4, Sūkta 39, rik 2): अश्वरूपं वा देवं । अग्नेरश्वरूपस्यैव दधिक्राख्यत्वात् । अग्नेः तद्रूपत्वं ब्राह्मणे समाम्नातम् । तानग्निः अश्वो भूत्वाभ्यद्रवदिति । 'Agni in the form of a horse is called Dadhikra; the equine form of Agni has been declared in the Brāhmana thus: Agni, becoming a horse, pursued them.' 
Haradatta says: 'दधि - हवींषि, क्रामति - प्राप्नोति इति दधिक्रावा कश्चिद्देवविशेषः, अग्निरित्यन्ये । 'A certain deity who receives the oblations or Agni as others have it.' Nārāyana Yatīndra takes the term to denote. 'Him who pervades the Universe - the Supreme Being.' 
2. Whether it be Agni or Sūrya (and both are regarded only as different forms of the same Divine Energy) that is represented in this hymn as Jishnoh, victorious in his fight with the powers of darkness, as Aśvasya, illuminating the universe with his bright rays, and as Vājinah, moving with great speed in his triumphal procession, he is an apt emblem of heaven's perpetual King who dispels our ignorance, illumines our heart with divine wisdom and flies to our succour on the wings of grace. 
3. The object of this second performance of Mārjana is set forth in the prayer embodied in the second half of the hymn, where the worshipper asks for the gift of sweet speech (lit-fragrant mouth) wherewith to approach His throne with heart-felt Halle-lujahs, and long life to be devoted to His service and adoration.
