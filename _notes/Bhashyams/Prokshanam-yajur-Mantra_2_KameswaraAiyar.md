They are the first three verses of the 9th Sûkta of the 10th Mandala in the Rig Veda. They occur also in the Taittiriya 
Samhita (4th Kanda 1st Praśna 5th Anuvāka.) They are also found in the 1st Mandala of the Atharva Veda with slight 
modifications and in several places in the Taittiriya Aranyaka. <intro> 
The literal meaning is given below. 
1. Apah = 
Oh waters! Hi = indeed, Stha = you are, Mayobhuvah = the sources of happiness; Tāh = those (you), Nah = us, Urje - food,
 Dadhâtana = grant, Chakshase = for sight, Mahe = great, Ranāya = (and) deliglitful. 
Oh waters! you are indeed the 
sources of all comforts. Being such, grant us food so that our senses may grow strong and give us joy. 
2. Yah = which 
(is), Vah = your, Sivatamah = most blissful, Rasah - essence, Tasya - of that, Iha = here, Nah = us, Bhâjayata = make 
the recipients, Iva = as, Uśatîh = affectionate, Mātarah = mothers. 
That essence of yours, which is the most blissful, 
make us the recipients thereof, as affectionate mothers (feed their children with milk from their breast). 
3. Yasya 
Kshayâya = on account of whose existence, Jinvatha = you are pleased, Tasmai = that, Aram = enough, Gamâma = may we 
have. Apah - oh waters! Nah = us, Janayatha = grant offspring. 
May we be obtain enough of that essence of yours, the 
existence of which within you makes you feel glad. Oh waters! grant us offspring. 
This rik has thus been interpreted by
 Haradattâchârya and Nârâyana Yatīndra in their commentary on the Sandhyâ. Vidyâranya offers a slightly different 
interpretation, thus: We come to you, till we be satisfied, for that food by the existence of which within you, you 
please herbs and plants; and he has also given another interpretation, thus: We quickly invoke you for the destruction 
of those sins which you please us by destroying. 
Comment. 1. Haradattâchârya quotes a sloka in this connection. 
आपो 
हिष्ठाः सुप्रसिद्धाः नवपादा भवन्ति ते । पादे पादे क्षिपेद्वारि ब्रह्महत्या व्यपोहति ॥ <quote> 
These Mantras – 
Apohishthâ etc., are well-known. They have nine feet. Water is to be sprinkled (on the head) while each foot is being 
recited. It will wash away even the sin of Brahmicide.' 
2. Nârâyana Yatîndra prefaces his interpretation of these riks 
with these remarks: आपोहिष्ठादिमन्त्राणां श्रीपाश्चरात्रादि सच्छास्त्रेषु परमात्मा देवतेत्यभिधानात् अत्रत्याः 
देवताशब्दाः परमात्मनारायणवाचकाः । अतः अन्यपरतया प्रतीयमानानामपि शब्दानां नामरूपव्याकरणश्रुत्या परमात्मपरत्वं हि वेदान्ते
 निर्णीतम् ॥ <quote> 
'These Mantras are regarded in sacred works like the Pâncharâtras as addressed to the Supreme 
Lord. We should therefore regard the address here as directed to the Lord (and not to the waters). The Vedanta has 
established in the Vedic passage relating to the analysis of names and forms (Chhand. Upanis VI) that even words which 
appear to denote other things signify really the Supreme Being'. The Vedic bards were genuine lovers of nature. They had
 'the divine afflatus,' in them. This 'divine afflatus', like gunpowder stored up, required a spark to liberate it and 
set it at work. Nature in her different manifestations furnished the required spark, and the mind of the Vedic seer 
'pregnant with celestial fire,' poured itself out 'in profuse strains of unpremeditated art'. The rapturous song was 
really directed to the Supreme Being; but the more immediate inspirer of the song, the particular aspect of nature which
 appealed to his feelings had the honor of the form. 
From the Rig Veda, Prof. Max Muller says “we learn a lesson, which
 it is well to learn, and which we can hardly learn anywhere else ......... how the Beyond or the Infinite was named by 
different names in order to bring it near the mind of man, to make it for a time comprehensible, until, when name after 
name had proved of no avail, a nameless God was left to answer best the restless cravings of the human heart." ('India -
 What can it teach us?' - Lect. V.) 
3. Water is here regarded as the source of life, as things that sustain life cannot
 grow in the absence of rain. The Vedic seer prays in these riks for this life-sustaining essence whereby his senses may
 grow strong, his intellect clear, and he himself, strong enough to bear children (propagation of the line being 
considered a religious duty which one owes to one's fathers). 
4. Janayatha. This word is taken by Vidyâranya and 
Haradattâcharya to mean 'make us have children'; but Nârâyana Yatīndra interprets it to mean 'bring us into existence'. 
He quotes from the Upanishads to show that what we usually call birth is not birth in the highest sense of the term; 
there is a higher and nobler birth - the springing of divine knowledge. "विद्या तत् संजनयति तत् श्रेष्ठं जन्म". This 
divine knowledge - the realisation of the Supreme Soul - is, he says, what has been called 'Śivatamah Rasah' or 'the 
most blissful essence' in these riks. This bliss alone, is eternal; all other joys, the most lasting of them, are but 
transient. As the saying goes, आविरिञ्चादमङ्गलम्, all conditions of existence up to the exalted position of Brahma the 
creator - are but miserable. 
But what is meant by saying that waters possess this most blissful essence - divine 
wisdom? Nârâyana Yatîndra thus answers the question. Mere. water cannot bestow earthly or heavenly happiness. The 
Ganges, Setu and other sacred places bestow great happiness only through their special relation to God. We have a 
passage in the Kaushi. Upanishad where the waters are said to contend for supremacy with others. Waters, in this 
passage, are taken to refer to the Deity presiding over the waters. Similarly, the term waters here means the Supreme 
Lord. And what is the most blissful essence that the Lord can grant us? It is spiritual insight. The springing of this 
spiritual vision which leads to the realisation of the Universal Self is the second and far more important birth and it 
is this second birth that is prayed for in the riks.Thus far Nârâyana Yatīndra.  
Western scholars who see in the hymns 
of the Rig Veda the primitive simplicity of a race that have just awakened to the wonders of nature around them would 
consider all this as ingenuity wasted in the attempt to read later philosophy into the primitive hymns. Perhaps they 
might be right. But the orthodox view is that Truth is one, and eternal; it may appear in several garbs - one way in the
 Samhitas, another way in the Upanishads and a third way in the Purânas; but the truth underneath all these disguises is
 the same.  
5. The three verses recited are in Gâyatrī metre. A verse in Gâyatrí metre has three pâdas (feet), each 
foot having eight syllables. Water is sprinkled over the head and other parts of the body, each time a foot is recited.
